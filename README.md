# Devoloping an Advertisement Proposal
Every year California students are required to take the Smarter Balanced ELA/ Math Exam. This is a cumulative exam given in the end of the school year to gauge student understading of core concepts. Parents recieve the results by paper in August. Therefore, my propsed idea is to create an ad campaign based on this exam. Specifically, in August, I am proposing that the tutoring service realeases facebook ads that convey the message that their services would help improve their students performance on these tests. I hypothesize that that by posting ads that specifically target this event, we would be able to increase clicks in August, which is a critical month as it is right before school starts. This is because the content will be more relevent to the target audience. 
The goal of this notebook is to thoroughly develop a proposal for the ad idea, which will be presented to the organization. 
The purpose of the notebook is to explore the demographics of nearby schools, analyze how certain target demographic groups performed on the Smarter Balanced Exam, and delve deeper into the proposed Marketing idea.
